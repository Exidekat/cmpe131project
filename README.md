# GAR - GPT AutoReply
The goal of this project is to create a texting assistant that will provide an automated reply system to your texts. It will be powered with a GPT model to predict what the user's most likely response to a text will be. It will use text history and facial queues as context.

Former proposed project for SJSU's CMPE 131 Software Engineering Final Project submission by the RYH
team.
